Be sure to backup your original file before replacing it. DLSS 2.x files are not interchangable with DLSS 1.x versions.

It is possible for game modders to "upgrade" the DLSS version of many games, simply by replacing its nvngx_dlss.dll with a newer version, which you can download on this page.

Go to your game's folder, looks for a file "nvngx_dlss.dll", and overwrite it with the downloaded file.

All files are digitally signed with NVIDIA's signature, so you can be sure they are unaltered.
